# Fake_News_Generator_in_python
Fake News Generator is a fun Python project that creates fake, funny, or random news headlines using templates and random words. It combines data from JSON files like names, animals, objects, and places to form unique headlines. Users can also create and save their own templates and revisit all generated news anytime.
